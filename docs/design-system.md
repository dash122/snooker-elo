# Design system — the short version

One rule underneath all of this: **if a value isn't in `app/styles/tokens.css`, it doesn't ship.**
`npm run lint:css` enforces it, so this is not a matter of discipline.

## Type — use a token, never a number

```css
font-size: var(--fs-body);   /* ✅ */
font-size: 14px;             /* ❌ stylelint rejects this */
```

The scale is **responsive**: the same token name resolves to a smaller size on narrower screens,
so a component names a *role* and never needs its own size. Base values live in `tokens.css`; the
tablet and phone steps live in `globals.css`.

| Token | Desktop | Narrow desktop | Phone | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--fs-label` | 12px | 11px | 11px | uppercase kickers, table headers, chips |
| `--fs-caption` | 13px | 12px | 12px | secondary metadata under a value |
| `--fs-sm` | 14px | 13px | 13px | dense body, form labels, list captions |
| `--fs-body` | 16px | 15px | 14.4px | default body text |
| `--fs-lead` | 18px | 17px | 16px | card titles, lead paragraphs |
| `--fs-h3` | 20px | 18px | 17px | |
| `--fs-stat` | 24px | 24px | 24px | headline numbers |
| `--fs-h2` | 26px | 24px | 20px | |

Plus three fixed sizes that don't step:

| Token | Size | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--fs-input` | 16px | **every** text input/select/textarea — below 16px iOS Safari zooms the page on focus |
| `--fs-display` | 32px | hero headings, empty-state glyphs |
| `--fs-display-lg` | 38px | the primary ranking hero only |

Nothing resolves below 11px. It isn't legible on a phone.
Landing-page heroes that must scale with the viewport may use `clamp()` — that's the one exception.

## Spacing — six steps

`--sp-1` 4px · `--sp-2` 8px · `--sp-3` 12px · `--sp-4` 16px · `--sp-5` 24px · `--sp-6` 32px

Pick the nearest step. Never split the difference — "just 2px more" is how we got 100+ padding values.

## Breakpoints — three tiers, and only three

```css
@media (max-width: 599px)  { }  /* phone   — single column */
@media (max-width: 820px)  { }  /* tablet  — mobile nav, roomier */
@media (min-width: 821px)  { }  /* desktop — side nav */
@media (max-width: 1180px) { }  /* narrow desktop — compact side nav */
```

Stylelint rejects any other width. A component changes layout at a **tier boundary**, never at a
width chosen to suit that one component. This is what stops "different cards reflow at different
widths on the same phone".

Custom properties can't be used inside a media query, so these stay as literal numbers — the
lint rule is what keeps the list at three, not the token file.

## Colour

Use a `--ds-*` token. Raw hex is rejected everywhere except `tokens.css`, where the palette is
defined. If you need a colour that doesn't exist, add a **named** token — don't inline the hex.

## The exemption list

`app/globals.css`, `app/login/auth.css` and `app/elo-guide/guide.css` predate this system and are
exempt from the colour and type rules (not the breakpoint rule). That list lives in
`.stylelintrc.json` and **may only ever get shorter**. As each page is migrated out of
`globals.css`, delete its entry. When the array is empty, the migration is finished.

Never add a file to it.

## Measuring

```bash
npm run design:metrics
```

Prints the current numbers against their targets. Run it after any styling work — every number
should move toward its target, never away.
